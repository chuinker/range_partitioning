1.2.2 (2016.02.01):
    - allow user to specify a range type in create_parent()
    - additional validation checks for:
        - mulitple matching range types when no range type specified
        - invalid/incompatible range type specified
        - invalid table name
        - invalid column name
1.2.1 (2016.01.21):
    - fix formatting in is_subrange()
    - proper permission inheritance
1.2.0 (2016.01.20):
    - master_partition view.
    - dynamic range functions - where the exact range type is not known at query time
        - value_in_range():  value <@ range
        - is_subrange(): little <@ big
        - range_add(): range1 + range2
        - range_subtract(): range1 - range2 
        - constructor_clause(): generate sql that will generate a range_type(low,high,bounds)
    - get_destination_partition() for probing which partition would receive a tuple.
    - leverage the dynamic range functions within partition management. they aren't as efficient as pure dynamic sql
      but the cost is miminal (a few ms for 100 partitions, 150ms for 10,000 partitions), and the code is a lot cleaner
1.1.1 (2016.01.06):
    - make master and partition pg_dump-able.
1.1 (2015.12.31):
    - Constraint exclusion fix
    - Re-generate check constraints programmatically (useful for development and possibly migrations).
